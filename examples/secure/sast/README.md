# Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in GitLab CI/CD

This directory contains examples and best practices for implementing Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

SAST is a testing methodology that analyzes source code to identify security vulnerabilities. GitLab's built-in SAST capabilities analyze your code for known vulnerabilities before they reach production.

## Key Features

### 1. Automated Security Scanning

The examples demonstrate how to:
- Integrate SAST scans into your CI/CD pipeline
- Configure language-specific analyzers
- Customize security rules
- Handle security findings

### 2. GitLab Security Dashboard

Utilizing GitLab's Security Dashboard to:
- Visualize security vulnerabilities
- Track security posture over time
- Prioritize remediation efforts
- Enforce security policies

### 3. Vulnerability Management

Implementing security vulnerability workflows:
- Automated issue creation
- Security approvals in merge requests
- Vulnerability tracking
- Security SLAs

### 4. Custom Rules and Compliance

Configuring SAST to meet compliance requirements:
- Custom security rules
- Compliance frameworks (e.g., OWASP, PCI-DSS)
- Security policy enforcement
- Audit trails

### 5. Shift-Left Security

Integrating security earlier in the development lifecycle:
- IDE integrations
- Pre-commit hooks
- Developer feedback loops
- Security as code

## Example Implementation

See the [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) file for a complete implementation of SAST scanning in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
