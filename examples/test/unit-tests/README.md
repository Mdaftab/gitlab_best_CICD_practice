# Unit Testing in GitLab CI/CD

This directory contains examples and best practices for implementing unit testing in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

## What are Unit Tests?

Unit tests validate that individual components of your application work as expected in isolation. They are:
- Fast to execute
- Independent of external services
- First line of defense against bugs

## Key Benefits

- Early detection of code issues
- Documentation of expected behavior
- Safe refactoring
- Improved code design

## GitLab CI/CD Implementation

### Basic Configuration

The included `.gitlab-ci.yml` file demonstrates how to:
- Run unit tests in parallel
- Cache dependencies for faster execution
- Generate and store test reports
- Configure test coverage tracking

### Features Demonstrated

1. **Optimized Test Execution**
   - Parallel test execution
   - Test splitting strategies
   - Failed test retry mechanisms

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Efficient caching
   - Vendored dependencies

3. **Test Reporting**
   - JUnit-compatible test reports
   - Code coverage reports
   - Test duration tracking

4. **Integration with GitLab Features**
   - Merge request test summary
   - Pipeline test reports
   - Coverage visualization

## Example Implementation

See the [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) file for a complete implementation.
