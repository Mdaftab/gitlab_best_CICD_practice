# Docker Build Optimization in GitLab CI/CD

This directory contains examples and best practices for optimizing Docker builds in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

Docker builds are a common part of modern CI/CD pipelines. This example demonstrates how to:
- Optimize Docker build performance
- Cache Docker layers
- Use GitLab's Container Registry
- Implement multi-stage builds
- Employ image scanning and validation

## Key Features

### 1. Build Caching

The examples use GitLab's caching mechanisms to speed up Docker builds:
- Docker layer caching
- BuildKit caching
- Dependency caching

### 2. Security Scanning

Implement container scanning to:
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Detect outdated packages
- Enforce security policies

### 3. Multi-Architecture Builds

Create Docker images that work across different architectures:
- x86_64 / amd64
- ARM64 / aarch64
- Multi-platform manifest lists

### 4. Container Registry Integration

Efficiently use GitLab's Container Registry:
- Automatic image tagging
- Version management
- Registry cleanup

### 5. Build Optimization

Techniques for faster and smaller Docker builds:
- Multi-stage builds
- Efficient Dockerfile instructions
- Layer optimization
- Distroless and minimal base images

## Example Implementation

See the [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) file for a complete implementation that demonstrates these practices.
