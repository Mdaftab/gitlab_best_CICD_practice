# GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Architecture Overview

A well-designed GitLab CI/CD pipeline architecture is crucial for efficient software delivery. This document provides an overview of GitLab pipeline architecture and key components.

## Pipeline Structure

A GitLab CI/CD pipeline is a configurable, automated process that defines how your code progresses from development to production. It consists of:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│             │     │             │     │             │     │             │
│  Test Stage │ ──► │ Build Stage │ ──► │Deploy Stage │ ──► │Secure Stage │
│             │     │             │     │             │     │             │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
       │                  │                   │                   │
       ▼                  ▼                   ▼                   ▼
┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐
│ Unit Tests   │   │ Build Apps   │   │ Deploy to    │   │ SAST         │
│ Lint Tests   │   │ Build Docker │   │ Dev/Test     │   │ DAST         │
│ Integration  │   │ Create       │   │ Deploy to    │   │ Dependency   │
│ Tests        │   │ Artifacts    │   │ Production   │   │ Scanning     │
└──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘
```

### Key Components

#### 1. `.gitlab-ci.yml`

The pipeline configuration file placed in the root of your repository. This YAML file defines:
- Stages
- Jobs
- Rules and conditions
- Variables
- Dependencies

#### 2. Stages

Stages group jobs and run in sequence. Common stages include:
- Test
- Build
- Deploy
- Secure

#### 3. Jobs

Jobs are the fundamental building blocks of a pipeline. Each job:
- Belongs to a stage
- Runs scripts or commands
- Is executed by a GitLab Runner
- Can have conditions determining when it runs
- Can have dependencies on other jobs

#### 4. GitLab Runners

Runners are the execution agents that process pipeline jobs:
- Shared runners (provided by GitLab)
- Specific runners (dedicated to certain projects)
- Group runners (available to all projects in a group)

#### 5. Artifacts

Files produced during job execution that can be:
- Passed between jobs
- Downloaded after pipeline completion
- Archived and expired after a defined period

#### 6. Caching

Mechanism to store dependencies and build outputs between pipeline runs:
- Speeds up subsequent pipeline executions
- Reduces redundant downloads and builds
- Can be scoped to specific branches or jobs

## Pipeline Types

### 1. Basic Linear Pipeline

A sequential flow where stages execute one after another.

### 2. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Pipeline

More complex pipelines where jobs can run based on specific dependencies rather than strict stage ordering.

### 3. Parent-Child Pipeline

Multi-project pipelines where one pipeline can trigger others, enabling:
- Modular pipeline configurations
- Cross-project dependencies
- Dynamic pipeline generation

### 4. Merge Request Pipelines

Pipelines that run specifically for merge requests:
- Validate changes before merging
- Can run different jobs than the main pipeline
- Support merge request approval workflows

## Key GitLab Features

### 1. Environments

Define deployment targets with tracking and controls:
- Environment-specific variables
- Deployment history
- Manual actions
- Protected environments

### 2. Manual Jobs

Jobs that require manual intervention to start:
- Approval workflows
- Controlled deployments
- Emergency stops

### 3. Pipeline Schedules

Time-based pipeline triggers:
- Regular maintenance tasks
- Nightly builds
- Periodic testing

### 4. Rules and Workflow

Conditional logic that determines when jobs run:
- Branch-specific jobs
- Tag-based deployments
- Environment-specific configurations
